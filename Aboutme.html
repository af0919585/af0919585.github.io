		My name is Allen. I am 16 years old and I attend Republic High School. I decided that I wanted to take computer science courses at OTC 
		because of my love for video games and simple coding that I did with my dad a long time ago. I would sit with him and watch him make simple games like pong clones and rom hacks, I would love to be able to experience
		that again.
